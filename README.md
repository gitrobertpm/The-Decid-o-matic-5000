# The-Decid-o-matic-5000
A wise machine that can make your decisions for you.

Ladies and gentlemen, come one, come all to witness the wonders of the Decid-o-matic 5000, a true marvel of the modern age.  No longer will you have to bother with the difficult and pesky task of making your own decisions.  Never again be troubled by those stress-inducing shoulda's and coulda's.  I mean, who needs it?

It's actually not that big of a deal, and I'm sure that there are better, shorter, easier, and DRYer ways to write this code, but this is the biggest and coolest thing I have ever programmed.  I think it runs pretty smooth, and the styling aint to shabby either, and on all screen sizes, except for possibly the very smallest.

Works best and looks best in firefox.  I'm having trouble getting the scale to work in both ie and chrome, but everything runs like a charm in firefox.
